# CalPal Nutrition Calculator

A Chrome extension for calculating daily protein, calories, and macronutrients, designed to be simple, fast, and offline-ready.

## Problem Statement

Many nutrition calculators are web-based, cluttered with ads, or require an internet connection. Users need a straightforward tool to quickly calculate their daily needs without these distractions.

## Solution Approach

I built a lightweight and focused Chrome extension with two main functions: a daily protein calculator and a calorie and macronutrient calculator. The extension is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, ensuring it's fast and can be used offline. It uses established formulas like the Mifflin-St Jeor equation for BMR and the Hamwi formula for ideal body weight.

## Key Features

- **Daily Protein Calculator**: Calculates daily protein needs based on age, gender, height, weight, and desired protein intake range. It also includes a 1.1x multiplier for seniors over 65.
- **Calories & Macros Calculator**: Determines total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) based on BMR and activity level. It also breaks down calories into custom macronutrient percentages for protein, carbs, and fats.
- **Tabbed Interface**: Easily switch between the protein and calorie calculators.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures all required fields are filled correctly and provides clear error messages.
- **Offline First**: All assets and calculations are local to the extension, so it works without an internet connection.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or libraries were used to keep the extension lightweight.
- **Formulas**:
    - **Protein**: Hamwi formula for Ideal Body Weight (IBW), with adjustments for actual body weight.
    - **Calories**: Mifflin-St Jeor equation for Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), multiplied by an activity level factor to get TDEE.
- **Structure**: The extension uses a simple tab-based navigation system to switch between the two calculator functions.

### Code Example
```javascript
// Calculate BMR using Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
let bmr;
if (gender === 'male') {
  bmr = (10 * weightKg) + (6.25 * heightCm) - (5 * age) + 5;
} else {
  bmr = (10 * weightKg) + (6.25 * heightCm) - (5 * age) - 161;
}

// Apply activity multiplier
let activityMultiplier;
switch (activityLevel) {
  case 'sedentary':
    activityMultiplier = 1.2;
    break;
  case 'light':
    activityMultiplier = 1.375;
    break;
  case 'moderate':
    activityMultiplier = 1.55;
    break;
  case 'active':
    activityMultiplier = 1.725;
    break;
  case 'veryactive':
    activityMultiplier = 1.9;
    break;
  default:
    activityMultiplier = 1.2;
}

// Calculate TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
const tdee = Math.round(bmr * activityMultiplier);
```

## Results & Impact

- The extension provides a simple, ad-free, and offline-capable tool for users to manage their nutrition.
- It serves as a solid foundation for future features, such as meal tracking or integration with other health services.

## Lessons Learned

- Building with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is a great way to create a fast and lightweight application.
- Clear UI and focused functionality are key to a good user experience, especially for a utility application.
- Writing clean, well-structured code is important, even for a small project, to make it easier to maintain and extend in the future.

## Future Roadmap

- Add a food database to track daily intake.
- Allow users to save their results and track their progress over time.
- Add more customization options, such as different formulas for calculating BMR and TDEE.
